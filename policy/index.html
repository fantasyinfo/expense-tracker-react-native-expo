    <h1>Privacy Policy for Kharcha</h1>
    <p class="date">Last updated: January 31, 2025</p>

    <p><strong>Kharcha</strong> ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how your information is handled when you use our mobile application.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p><strong>We do not collect, store, or share any of your personal data.</strong></p>
    <p>Kharcha is a 100% offline application. All data you enter into the app (expenses, income, goals, profile information) is stored locally on your device's internal storage. We do not have servers, and we do not transmit your data to any external cloud services.</p>

    <h2>2. Permissions</h2>
    <p>The app requires the following permissions to function:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Storage/Files</strong>: To save and retrieve your expense data locally and to generate reports (PDF/CSV/JSON) when you explicitly request an export.</li>
        <li><strong>Media/Photos</strong>: To allow you to save exported reports to your device.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Data Security</h2>
    <p>Since your data is stored only on your device, its security depends on your device's security. We recommend keeping your device software updated and using device-level security features like PINs or biometrics.</p>

    <h2>4. Updates to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The updated version will be indicated by an updated "Revised" date and the updated version will be effective as soon as it is accessible.</p>
